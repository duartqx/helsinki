## Create a similar diagram depicting the situation where the user creates a new note on the page https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes by writing something into the text field and clicking the Save button.

### Example

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/notes
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the css file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/main.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser starts executing the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server

    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ... ]
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser executes the callback function that renders the notes
```

Let's say I'll type `Creating a new note on the notes app` into the input field and press the Save button, the sequence is not all that different from the one in the example, the difference being the browser executes an extra HTTP request, the POST, and receives a response with status 302 pointing to the Location `/exampleapp/notes`, the browser then automatically makes a GET request to that endpoint and the page reloads. It would be much better if the POST response included the created note instead of a redirect, but since this is an example on what NOT to do I undestand.

The updated diagram including the note I created looks kind of like this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: POST /exampleapp/new_note
    activate server
    server-->>browser: 302 Redirect to Location /exampleapp/notes
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The form has method POST and action pointing to /exampleapp/new_note (The endpoint that will proccess our request)

    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/notes
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser follows the redirect response and returns the same html document we had received previously when first accessing the page

    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the css file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/main.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file (this script will make another GET request to receive the notes json)
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser starts executing the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server (So many steps for this simple page)

    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ ..., "content": "Creating a new note on the notes app", "date": "2024-1-7" }, ... ]
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser executes the callback function that renders the notes (this includes the one we just created)
```
