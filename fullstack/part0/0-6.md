### Create a diagram depicting the situation where the user creates a new note using the single-page version of the app.

#### Answer

When the user submits the form using the spa version it instead of reloading the page, like the previous version, it actually prevents the default behavior of the form and instead it adds the new note to the current state of the page, redraws all notes using a function from spa.js and then it makes the POST request to the server at the endpoint /exampleapp/new_note_spa to save the new note

    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/spa

    activate server
    Note left of server: The Express powered server receives the request and responds with a HTML document
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The HTML document received in the previous response links to main.css and spa.js
    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: Css
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The spa.js has the logic on how and where to build the interface and for that it needs to make another GET request using XMLHttpRequest
    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/spa.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: Javascript file spa.js
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser runs the script inside spa.js, this executes a GET XMLHttpRequest for the data.json
    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: Responds with the data.json file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: After the request for data.json is completed, the browser builds the list with notes using the logic in spa.js

    Note right of browser: The user submits the form to save a new note

    Note right of browser: When spa.js ran in one of the previous steps, it
    Note right of browser: verwrote the default behavior of the form submition, so it actually
    Note right of browser: xecutes a javascript function instead. This function appends the new note
    Note right of browser: o the notes array and reenders all notes + the new one, it then sends a
    Note right of browser: OST request to the server that responds with a status 201 Created and body
    Note right of browser: "message": "note created"}. Since the script adds the note to the screen
    Note right of browser: efore the server responds, it actually could result in the server
    Note right of browser: esponding with status in the 400-599 range and this being ignored

    browser->>server: POST /exampleapp/new_note_spa
    activate server
    server-->>browser: Status 201 {"message": "note created"}
    deactivate server

```
