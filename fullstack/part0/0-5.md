#### Answer

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/spa

    activate server
    Note left of server: The Express powered server receives the request and responds with a HTML document
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The HTML document received in the previous response links to main.css and spa.js
    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: Css
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The spa.js has the logic on how and where to build the interface and for that it needs to make another GET request using XMLHttpRequest
    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/spa.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: Javascript file spa.js
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser runs the script inside spa.js, this executes a GET XMLHttpRequest for the data.json
    browser->>server: GET /exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: Responds with the data.json file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: After the request for data.json is completed, the browser builds the list with notes using the logic in spa.js
```
